1. **Project Title and Description**

  Objective
  
  Analyze technology news data to identify trends and drive lead development
  
  Approach Shift
  
  * Transition from raw data processing (NLP, LLMs, RAG) to leveraging a pre-populated knowledge graph
  * Focus on data analysis over data processing
  
  Key Activities
  
  * Insight Extraction: Utilize the knowledge graph constructed from technology news articles to uncover insights
  * Relationship Analysis: Investigate connections between entities such as Articles, Keywords, People, and Organizations, Products and Industries, and Sentiment Analysis
  
  Deliverables
  
  * Natural Language Summaries: Concise insights presented in an easily digestible format
  * Statistical Analyses: Quantitative findings to support decision-making
  * Visualizations: Graphical representations to highlight trends and patterns in the technology sector
